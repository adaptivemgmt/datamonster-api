The follow git hooks have been added for the datamonster-api repo to improve the developer coding experience!

Our pre-push hooks include the following:
- Python's `pre-commit` library to check flake8 and black compliance

To read more about using the `pre-commit` library, installation instructions and such, please see:
https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/


To use these git hooks, run:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `git config core.hooksPath .dm-hooks`

To use the default git hooks (or one's local hooks), run:
`git config core.hooksPath .git/hooks`


TIPS:
- use `git push --no-verify` to skip over our pre-push hooks!
